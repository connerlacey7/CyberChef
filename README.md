## How to run

Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

Copy the `recipes.db` file in the `server` directory into the `server/tmp` directory.

Run `npm run client` to run the client application.

Run `npm run server` to run the server.

You will need to have the client and the server running at the same time for the application to work.
